This is my life now

Anyway, this is going to be some app where you can type in an artist's name, and it'll
give you two of that artist's songs and ask you to gauge which one is better. Potential plans
in the future might involve some sort of bracket a la Brackify?

rather rough outline/todo:
- get list of songs
- populate song list
- intro page
- actual choice/bracket (via React?)
- learn Markdown
- allow user to pass in blacklisted keywords
- uncover inevitable security flaw
- pretty things up
- host this somewhere

completed (kinda):
- turn songNames into a set of Song objects (not in curr version)
- make this an actual server (localhost)
- client side (started)
- client/server interactionâ„¢
