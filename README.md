This is my love letter to JavaScript

Anyway, this is going to be some app where you can type in an artist's name, and it'll
give you two of that artist's songs and ask you to gauge which one is better. Potential plans
in the future might involve some sort of bracket a la Brackify?

rather rough outline/todo:
- intro page

- allow user to choose albums
- populate song list
- actual choice/bracket (via React?)

- FIX AUTHENTICATION SO IT CAN DISCOVER IF IT NEEDS TO REAUTHENTICATE
- learn Markdown
- LINT JS BECAUSE MY CODE IS UGLY
- allow user to pass in blacklisted keywords
- uncover inevitable security flaw
- test use of multiple users at same time
- pretty things up
- host this somewhere

completed (kinda):
- get list of albums
- turn songNames into a set of Song objects (not in curr version)
- make this an actual server (localhost)
- client side (started)
- client/server interactionâ„¢
- authentication on serverside to remove hassle
