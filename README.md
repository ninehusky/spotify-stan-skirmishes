This is my life now

Anyway, this is going to be some app where you can type in an artist's name, and it'll
give you two of that artist's songs and ask you to gauge which one is better. Potential plans
in the future might involve some sort of bracket a la Brackify?

rather rough outline/todo:
- learn Markdown
- update this file
- turn songNames into a set of Song objects
- make this an actual server
- uncover inevitable security flaw
- client side
- pretty things up
- client/server interactionâ„¢
- host this somewhere
